Prometheus database server and endpoint for database

The Prometheus and myphpadmin databases are now running on the ubuntu (18) server (from AWS).
To reach the databases use the following endpoints:
- Prometheus: http://18.224.29.151:9090
- Myphpadmin: http://18.224.29.151/phpmyadmin

## Coding style
In this repository we use the PEP8 coding style. If you contribute, please make sure your code is PEP8 compliant. Install the PEP8 command line tool with this command:
```bash
    pip install pep8
```
Then you can just use ```pep8 your_python_file.py``` in your terminal to see if your code is PEP8 compliant.
